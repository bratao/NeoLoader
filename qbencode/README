-----

This library is a type safe implementation of bencode (de)serialization 
for the Qt framework. C++ template system is used to reduce the amount 
of code required to manipulate data structures during conversion and 
thus makes it less error-prone and more readable. Supported Qt types are 
QByteArray, QString, QList, QMap and QPair. The encoding is the same as 
used in the official BitTorrent protocol, but it is extended to include 
UTF-8 encoded strings and boolean values. Strings in the official bencode
are represented using QByteArray and UTF-8 encoded strings as QString.

Why bencode?

While less efficient than a pure binary encoding, bencoding is simple 
and (because numbers are encoded in decimal notation) is unaffected by 
endianness, which is important for a cross-platform application like 
BitTorrent. It is also fairly flexible, as long as applications ignore 
unexpected dictionary keys, so that new ones can be added without 
creating incompatibilities. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode)
